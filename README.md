# Password Generator
This tool generates a password based on user input.

## Description
When you click the button to generate a password you are presented with a series of prompts for password criteria.<br>
When prompted for password criteria, you can select which criteria to include in the password.<br>
When prompted for the length of the password you can choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters.<br>
If you do not enter a valid number you get a message to try again.<br>
When asked for character types to include in the password you can confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.<br>
If you do not select any character sets you get a message to try again.<br>
